Corruption of Arcana is a high-fantasy, turn-based, 2.5D, RPG Card game where no journey is the same.
Play your cards right and reach the root of corruption taking hold of the world. Purify or use the corruption against itself in a realm where fortune favors the bold.

This was our first project as a team and was a game we all fell in love with making, helping us to go beyond what we thought we could create in our development window.
